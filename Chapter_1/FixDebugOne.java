The class name was written as "FixDebug One" with a space. It should be "FixDebugOne".

The method name was written as "Main" with a capital M. In Java, it should be "main" in lowercase.

The parameter in the main method was incorrect. It was written as (String args) but should be (String[] args).

On the fifth line, "System" was misspelled as "Systm", and the semicolon at the end of the statement was missing.

Finally, the program did not include a closing bracket } at the end.
